## Outline

1. What is Slurm? 
2. Cluster info  
3. Submitting jobs  
4. Monitoring jobs  
5. Other commands  
6. Job dependencies  
7. Job arrays

---

## First some terminology

- **compute node** &mdash; individual computer with certain specs (CPUs, RAM, etc.)
- **login (head) node** &mdash; special node for accessing cluster and submitting jobs
- **cluster** &mdash; set of interconnected compute nodes
- **partition** &mdash; distinct group of compute nodes within a cluster
- **shell** &mdash; program for running commands (read-evaluate-print loop)
- **script** &mdash; text file with a sequence of commands to execute
- **job** &mdash; distinct set of computational work to be performed
- **scheduler** &mdash; program that controls when and where jobs are run on a cluster

---

## What is Slurm?

- Open-source management and job scheduling system for Linux computing clusters
- Three main functions
  1. Allocates access to resources (compute nodes)
  2. Provides a framework to run and monitor jobs on allocated nodes
  3. Manages a job queue for competing resource requests
- Unique configuration for CARC clusters
- [Official docs](https://slurm.schedmd.com)

| Cluster info    | sinfo    | Display compute partition and node information |
| Submitting jobs | salloc   | Allocate resources for an interactive job |
|                 | sbatch   | Submit a job script for remote execution |
|                 | srun     | Launch parallel tasks (job steps) (typically for MPI jobs) |
|                 | squeue   | Display status of jobs and job steps |

---

## Custom Slurm commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| myqueue | Your job queue in a better format |
| jobhist | Compact job history |
| jobinfo | Detailed job information |

---

## Typical batch job workflow

1. Create job script
2. Submit job script with `sbatch`
3. Check job status with `myqueue` or `jobhist`
4. When job completes, check log file
5. If job failed, modify job and resubmit (back to step 1)
  - Look for warning and error messages in log file
  - If needed, check job information with `jobinfo`
6. If job succeeded, check job information with `jobinfo`
  - Review efficiency information
  - If possible, use less resources next time for similar job

---

## Discovery cluster partitions

| Partition | Purpose |
|---|---|
| main       | Serial and small-to-medium parallel jobs (single node or multiple nodes) |
| epyc-64    | Medium-to-large parallel jobs (single node or multiple nodes) |
| gpu        | Jobs requiring GPU nodes |
| oneweek    | Long-running jobs (up to 7 days) |
| largemem   | Jobs requiring larger amounts of memory (up to 1 TB) |
| debug      | Short-running jobs for debugging purposes |

---

## sinfo

- Display compute partition and node information
- Default output lists information by partition and node status
- `sinfo2` is alias for listing information by partition, node type, and node status
- `sinfo --help`
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sinfo.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sinfo.html)

```bash
$ sinfo

$ sinfo -lNp debug

$ sinfo --states=idle

$ sinfo2
```

---

## sinfo notes

- Useful options include `--Node (-N)`, `--partition (-p)`, and `--states`
- Many formatting options with `--format (-o)` or `--Format (-O)`
  - Can also use SINFO_FORMAT environment variable to set
  - `export SINFO_FORMAT=...`
  - Add to `~/.bashrc` to automatically set when logging in

---

## Codes for common node states

- allocated
  - The node has been allocated to one or more jobs
- down
  - The node is unavailable for use
- draining
  - The node is currently executing a job, but will not be allocated additional jobs
- idle
  - The node is not allocated to any jobs and is available for use
- maint
  - The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance"
- mixed
  - The node has some of its CPUs ALLOCATED while others are IDLE
- reserved
  - The node is in an advanced reservation and not generally available

---

## Submitting jobs

- `salloc` &mdash; for interactive jobs
- `sbatch` &mdash; for batch jobs
- `srun` &mdash; for parallel (MPI) tasks (job steps) within batch jobs

---

## salloc

- Allocate resources for an interactive job
- Useful for development and debugging
- Similar options to `sbatch`
- `salloc --help`
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html)

```bash
$ salloc

$ salloc --partition=debug --cpus-per-task=8
```

---

## sbatch

- Submit a job script for remote execution
- A job script is a special type of Bash script
- `sbatch --help`
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)

```bash
$ sbatch my.job
```

---

## Example job script for multi-threaded job

- Generic structure
  1. Specify SBATCH options (resource requests)
  2. Load software and set up environment
  3. Run commands

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --mem=32GB
#SBATCH --time=2:00:00
#SBATCH --account=<project_id>

module purge
module load gcc/8.3.0
module load julia/1.6.1

julia --threads 16 script.jl
```

---

## Commonly used salloc/sbatch options

| Option | Description | Default values |
|---|---|---|
| `--nodes=<number>`             | Number of nodes to use | 1 |
| `--ntasks=<number>`            | Number of processes to run | 1 |
| `--cpus-per-task=<number>`     | Number of CPUs/cores per task | 1 |
| `--mem=<number>`               | Memory per node | n/a |
| `--mem-per-cpu=<number>`       | Memory per CPU/core | 2GB |
| `--time=<D-HH:MM:SS>`          | Maximum run time | 1:00:00 |
| `--partition=<partition_name>` | Request nodes on specified partition | main |
| `--constraint=<attribute>`     | Node property to request (e.g., `xeon-4116`) | n/a |
| `--account=<project_id>`       | Account to charge resources to | default |
| `--mail-type=<value>`          | E-mail notifications (e.g., `all`) | n/a |
| `--mail-user=<address>`        | E-mail address | n/a |

---

## sbatch notes

- Shell environment is transferred to job when submitted
- Use `module purge` to clear modules
- Use `--mem=0` to request all available memory on a node
- For submitting lots of similar jobs, use job arrays
- For submitting lots of short-running jobs, pack them together in one job

---

## Example job script for GPU job

- Add option: `#SBATCH --gres=gpu:<gpu_type>:<number>`
- [CARC User Guide for Using GPUs](https://carc.usc.edu/user-information/user-guides/software-and-programming/using-gpus)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --gres=gpu:p100:1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --mem=16GB
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#SBATCH --account=<project_id>

module purge
module load gcc/8.3.0
module load cuda/10.1.243

./cuda_program
```

---

## Job log files

- By default, output log files are named `slurm-<job_id>.out` and saved to the submit directory
- By default, both output and error messages are printed to the same output file
- Use `--output` and/or `--error` options to customize filenames or split output
- Filename patterns can be used (e.g., %x = job name &rarr; `#SBATCH --output=%x.out`)

---

## Job limits on Discovery

| Partition | Maximum run time | Maximum concurrent CPUs | Maximum concurrent GPUs | Maximum number of jobs queued | Maximum number of jobs running |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| main     |  48 hours   | 1,200 | 36  | 5,000 | 500 |
| epyc-64  |  48 hours   | 1,200 | n/a | 5,000 | 500 |
| gpu      |  48 hours   | 1,200 | 36  | 5,000 | 500 |
| oneweek  | 168 hours   | 208   | n/a | 50    | 50  |
| largemem | 168 hours   | 376   | n/a | 10    | 1   |
| debug    |   1 hour    | 48    | 6   | 5     | 5   |

*By default, Endeavour condo partitions will inherit the main partition limits*  
*But with a two-week maximum run time*  
*Custom limits can be requested for Endeavour condo partitions*

- Many formatting options with `--format` or `--Format`
  - Can also use SQUEUE_FORMAT environment variable to set
  - `export SQUEUE_FORMAT=...`
  - Add to `~/.bashrc` to automatically set when logging in
- Create shorter alias
  - `alias myq="squeue --me"`
  - Add to `~/.bashrc` to automatically set when logging in

---

## Job priorities

- Based on a fairshare algorithm and job age
- Fairshare values depend on a number of factors
  - Number of jobs submitted
  - Resources used
  - Project account activity
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/fair_tree.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/fair_tree.html)

---

## sprio

- Display job priority information
- `sprio --help`
- Can be difficult to interpret
- If normalized, a priority value closer to 1 means a higher priority

```bash
$ sprio -n -j <job_id>
```

---

## scancel

- Cancel pending or running jobs
- `scancel --help`
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html)

```bash
$ scancel <job_id>

$ scancel -u <username>
```

---

## Monitoring jobs

- `sstat` &mdash; view job status for currently running job
- `sacct` &mdash; view information about current or past jobs
- `seff` &mdash; view efficiency information about past jobs
- `jobhist` &mdash; view compact history of jobs
- `jobinfo` &mdash; view detailed job information

---

## sstat

- Display status information for running jobs
- `sstat --help`
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sstat.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sstat.html)

```bash
$ sstat -j <job_id>

$ sstat -j <job_id> --format=JobID,MaxRSS,AveCPUFreq,MaxDiskRead,MaxDiskWrite
```

---

## sacct

- Display accounting information for jobs
- `sacct --help`
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html)

```bash
$ sacct

$ sacct -j <job_id>

$ sacct --format=JobID,MaxRSS,AveCPUFreq,MaxDiskRead,MaxDiskWrite,State,ExitCode
```

---

## sacct notes

- By default, only displays jobs from past day
- Some useful options are `--starttime`, `--endtime`, `--brief`, and `--state`
- Many formatting options with `--format`
  - Can also use SACCT_FORMAT environment variable to set
  - `export SACCT_FORMAT=...`
  - Add to `~/.bashrc` to automatically set when logging in

---

## Job exit codes

- 0 &rarr; success
- non-zero &rarr; failure
- Exit code 1 indicates a general failure
- Exit code 2 indicates incorrect use of shell builtins
- Exit codes 3-124 indicate some error in job (check software exit codes)
- Exit code 125 indicates out of memory
- Exit code 126 indicates command cannot execute
- Exit code 127 indicates command not found
- Exit code 128 indicates invalid argument to exit
- Exit codes 129-192 indicate jobs terminated by Linux signals
  - For these, subtract 128 from the number and match to signal code
  - Enter `kill -l` to list signal codes
  - Enter `man signal` for more information

---

## seff

- Display job efficiency information for past jobs (CPU and memory use)
- Use to optimize resource requests

```bash
$ seff <job_id>
```

---

## jobhist and jobinfo

- Convenience commands with better output formats
- Alternatives to `sstat`, `sacct`, and `seff`

```bash
$ jobhist <days>

$ jobinfo <job_id>
```

---

## scontrol

- Display or modify Slurm configuration and state
- Mostly for admins, some commands for users
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html)

```bash
$ scontrol show partition <partition>

$ scontrol show node <node_id>

$ scontrol show job <job_id>

$ scontrol hold <job_id>

$ scontrol release <job_id>
```

---

## Job dependencies

- If a job depends on another job
- Defer the start of a job until the specified dependencies have been satisfied
- Some examples
  - Workflows
  - Checkpointing and splitting up long-running jobs
- Setting up a job dependency
  - Need job IDs (use `squeue` or `jobhist`)
  - Add `#SBATCH --dependency=<type>` to job script
  - Or use `sbatch --dependency=<type> my.job`
  - Different dependency types available


---

## Commonly used job dependency types

`--dependency=afterok:<job_id>[:<job_id>...]`

- This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed (ran to completion with an exit code of 0)

`--dependency=afternotok:<job_id>[:<job_id>...]`

- This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state (non-0 exit code, node failure, timed out, etc.)

`--dependency=after:<job_id>[[+time][:<job_id>[+time]...]]`

- After the specified jobs start or are cancelled and time in minutes from job start or cancellation happens, this job can begin execution. If no time is given, then there is no delay after start or cancellation

`--dependency=afterany:<job_id>[:<job_id>...]`

- This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated

---

## Job dependency example

```bash
$ sbatch jl.job
Submitted batch job 3353548

$ sbatch --dependency=afterok:3353548 jl2.job
Submitted batch job 3353549

$ squeue --me
  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
3353549      main  jl2.job  ttrojan PD       0:00      1 (Dependency)
3353548      main   jl.job  ttrojan  R       0:32      1 b22-31
```

---

## Job arrays

- For submitting and managing collections of similar jobs quickly and easily
- Some examples
  - Varying simulation or model parameters
  - Running the same processing steps on different datasets
  - Running the same statistical models on different datasets
- Setting up a job array
  - Add `#SBATCH --array=<index>` option to job script
  - Each job array task will use the same resources requested
  - Modify job or application script to use array index
  - Multiple implementation methods exist
- [https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html)
- For lots of short-running jobs, use [Launcher](https://carc.usc.edu/user-information/user-guides/software-and-programming/launcher)

## Job array example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --mem=16GB
#SBATCH --time=2:00:00
#SBATCH --array=1-3
#SBATCH --account=<project_id>

files <- list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
task <- as.numeric(Sys.getenv("SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"))
file <- files[task]
print(file)

data <- fread(file)

summary(data)

...
```
